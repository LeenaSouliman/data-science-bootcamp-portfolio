This allows the extrapolated data from animal images to be assigned to species of animal based on features. The model will be trained on a dataset with images labelled with the corresponding animal species. The models learn the patterns in the visual features that distinguish between different species and make predictions on new, unseen images to classify them into the appropriate species. \n","\n","* 2.4 Classification. \n","\n","    This is because the goal is to predict the likelihood of having a particular disease, which is definite and labelled, based on the input of the patient's medical history such as symptoms and test results. The algorithm deployed will learn to recognise patterns in the patient's medical history and map them to the likelihood of having the disease. The model will utilise a historical dataset where each patient's medical history is labelled with the presence or absence of disease, to which the model will then learn the patterns in medical history features that distinguish between patients with and without the disease.
